# Metabolism in New Hope Creek 50 years after the first measurement

This Project contains the data and code to model the metabolism across 3 years at 6 sites in New Hope Creek, NC, the site of the first annual metabolism study. There is also code for downloading climate drivers, quantifying change over time, and visualizing the modern and historical data, as well as building a time series model of metabolism to hindcast predictions to 1969.

Code and data in this repository were generated by Alice M Carter, Michael J Vlah, and Emily S Bernhardt.
